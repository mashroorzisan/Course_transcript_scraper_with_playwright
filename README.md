# Course-transcript scraper withplaywright

This repository contains three Python scripts for web scraping tasks using Playwright and pandas. The scripts perform the following functions:

1. **Link Scraper**: Extracts course links and course names from an infinite scroll website.
2. **Course Details Scraper**: Visits each course link extracted by the Link Scraper and retrieves additional course details.
3. **Course Details Merger**: Merges multiple Excel files containing course details into one consolidated file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Playwright
- pandas
- openpyxl (for handling Excel files)

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

## Scripts

### 1. Link Scraper

**Script Name**: `link_scraper.py`

**Description**: This script uses Playwright to handle an infinite scroll website, extracting all course links and course names.

**Usage**: Run the script to extract course links and names.

**Output**: The script saves the extracted course links and names to an Excel file named `course_links.xlsx`.

### 2. Course Details Scraper

**Script Name**: `course_details_scraper.py`

**Description**: This script reads the course links from the file generated by the Link Scraper, visits each link, and retrieves additional course details.

**Usage**: Run the script to scrape detailed information for each course.

**Output**: The script saves the course details to multiple Excel files, one for each course, named `course_details_<course_name>.xlsx`.

### 3. Course Details Merger

**Script Name**: `course_details_merger.py`

**Description**: This script merges multiple Excel files containing course details into one consolidated Excel file.

**Usage**: Run the script to merge all the detailed information into one file.

**Output**: The script saves the merged course details to an Excel file named `merged_course_details.xlsx`.

## Example Workflow

1. Run the `link_scraper.py` to extract course links and names.
2. Run the `course_details_scraper.py` to scrape detailed information for each course.
3. Run the `course_details_merger.py` to merge all the detailed information into one file.
